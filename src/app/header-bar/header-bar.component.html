    <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
          Under the working title of “<b>SharedAirDFW</b>” over 100 new custom-built air quality monitors 
          are being distributed throughout the DFW region in the next 12 months that will be able to 
          give residents real time information about the air they breathe for the first time. When it’s 
          up and running, <b>it’ll be the first network of its kind in Texas and one of the largest in the U.S.</b><br><br>

          Based out of the <b>University of Texas at Dallas</b> laboratories and fueled by its graduate students, 
          as well as Downwinders’ grant money, these monitors will offer real time information through a 
          easily accessible app.<br><br>

          Right now a handful of official EPA monitors provide air quality readings up to one or two hours 
          behind real time conditions. <b>SharedAirDFW will increase the number of calibrated air quality monitors 
          in DFW by a factor of four while giving readings updated every few seconds.</b><br><br>

          Almost half of the new monitors are going to front line communities in the DFW area: <b>33 monitors ies
          purchased by Downwinders are going to Joppa, West Dallas, and Midlothian, while another 11 purchased 
          by Paul Quinn College are slated for the Southern Dallas neighborhoods surrounding its campus.</b>
